<h1>SiteURL has started using Git</h1>
<p>I have learnt to use 'git add' 'git commit',  these commands can be done using a sing command 'git commit -a'
</p>
<p>We have to include a  message while commiting a change. 'git commit -a' opens VI. We have add a message in the editor, shoud save and exit. We can include this process in a single command 'git commit -a -m "Your Message"' </p>
